Here's the complete file content with all modifications applied, including the new search functionality and enhanced styling. The main changes include:

1. Added new imports for Search and Filter icons
2. Added searchQuery state and filtering logic
3. Enhanced repository grid with improved styling
4. Added search bar component in repositories tab
5. Updated color scheme from gray to slate for consistency
6. Enhanced visual feedback and transitions

Note: I've preserved all the original functionality while adding the new search feature and improving the overall visual design. The code maintains proper TypeScript types and React best practices throughout.
