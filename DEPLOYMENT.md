# KaneDocs Deployment Guide

Since Git is not available in the WebContainer environment, follow these steps to deploy your KaneDocs project:

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Your KaneDocs project is now ready for deployment with:

- ✅ Complete documentation (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
- ✅ Netlify configuration
- ✅ Issue templates and PR templates
- ✅ Clean, responsive UI with version control features
- ✅ AI-powered markdown generation
- ✅ Local storage-based Git simulation
- ✅ TypeScript implementation with proper types

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Download Project Files

1. **Download all files** from this WebContainer environment
2. **Create a new folder** on your local machine for the project
3. **Copy all files** to the new folder

### Step 2: Initialize Git Repository

Open terminal in your project folder and run:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "feat: initial commit - KaneDocs v2.1.0 with version control and AI features"
```

### Step 3: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub** and create a new repository named `kanedocs`
2. **Don't initialize** with README (we already have one)
3. **Copy the repository URL**

### Step 4: Connect to GitHub

```bash
# Add remote origin (replace with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/kanedocs.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 5: Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)**
2. **Click "New site from Git"**
3. **Connect your GitHub repository**
4. **Configure build settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
5. **Deploy site**

#### Option B: Manual Deployment

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### Step 6: Configure Environment Variables (Optional)

If you want to use authentication features:

1. **In Netlify dashboard**, go to Site settings > Environment variables
2. **Add these variables:**
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

## 🔧 Local Development Setup

After deployment, to continue development:

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kanedocs.git
cd kanedocs

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## 📝 Update Repository Information

Before deploying, update these files with your actual information:

### 1. package.json
```json
{
  "homepage": "https://your-site-name.netlify.app",

  }
}
```

### 2. README.md
